## 📊 Student Center Usage Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of student center usage data to evaluate the impact of facility upgrades (the Loo renovation). Using R and data visualization tools, the project compares daily and monthly student center visits in April (before upgrades) and September (after upgrades).

### 🔍 Features

Data import and cleaning from .xlsx files

Aggregated usage statistics by month

Comparative visualizations (bar charts, line plots) showing changes in student center usage

Code written in R with tidyverse, ggplot2, and readxl

### 🚀 Goals

Provide clear evidence of how the upgrade influenced student engagement

Demonstrate reproducible workflows in R for institutional decision-making

Offer visuals that can be shared in reports, presentations, or dashboards
